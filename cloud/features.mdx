## What are ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform's key benefits? 

With a portfolio of so many popular and successful open source tools, our prospects and users often ask about the key benefits of using ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform. Explore some of the main benefits and advantages of PDCP below.

### Faster, Cloud-hosted Scans

As a cloud-hosted offering, PDCP abstracts away the complexities of running Nuclei and other ProjectDiscovery open source tools at scale. 
Our cloud scanning engine is **50x faster than Nuclei**, completing scans of up to 20,000 targets in less than an hour.
This delivers scan results significantly faster and saves teams meaningful time that would otherwise be spent on maintaining infrastructure, writing custom scripts, and waiting for scan results to complete. 

### Collaboration 

Security is a team effort and open source tools can make it difficult to collaborate with teammates. ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform provides users with a shared workspace to run vulnerability scans, view results, and triage findings. PDCP also includes role-based access control so security teams can invite engineers and other stakeholders to the platform in view-only roles. 

### Tons of Automation

ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform was designed to automate the key workflows of the modern security team. Asset discovery and reconnaisance has been simplified from chaining multiple open source tools into one simple step. Automatically scan for newly released Nuclei templates, or set up regression tests for fixed vulnerabilities. Schedule daily discovery and scans, or set up custom schedules, continuous scanning, or workflow-based scans. Key actions like copying cURL requests, opening up vulnerable targets in a new tab, and initiating retest are all exposed to the user, saving multiple clicks and navigating between different applications.

### Powerful Integrations

ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform makes it easy to connect your key services and applications. PDCP supports integrations to your favorite messaging apps like Slack to be alerted of critical findings, ticketing systems like Jira to automate the remediation process and initiate retests, and cloud providers to pull in your live hosts for scanning. We also have a fully functional [API](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/api-reference/introduction) to customize any integrations in your organization.   

### Dashboards and Executive Reporting 

Showcase your security initiatives to leadership with beautiful dashboards and executive reports. Export vulnerability findings via PDF, JSON, or CSV. Leverage our real-time vulnerability scans to automatically scan your infrastructure for trending exploits and share findings proactively with your company. 

### Support

Direct access to the ProjectDiscovery team for support on optimal configurations, writing advanced custom templates, and anything else you need to ensure ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform meets your security needs.
